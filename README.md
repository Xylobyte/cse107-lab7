# CSE107 - Lab 7

This lab plays with dictionarys and using them to solve problems.

## Purpose

### lettercount.py

This program uses a dictionary to grab the letters of a given 
string and count the ocurrances of the letters within it.

### date.py

This program takes a string with a month, day, and year, and 
converts it to day of the year based on number of days in 
each month.

### horoscope.py

This program uses date.py to take a string with the month, day,
and year, and converts it to day of th year. It then uses
dictionaries to find the zodiac sign for that date and print the
corresponding horoscope.

### rpn_calculator.py

This program takes a string and parses it to calculate expressions
in reverse polish notation. It uses an artificial stack to store 
values and apply operations after the fact.

## Conclusion

* In this lab I practiced implementing dictionaries to make solving
  problems easier than using other value types like lists.
* Pair programming aided in giving me an outside look at my code
and allowed me to ask questions and give help to my partner when
it was needed.
* I did not work with my buddy on the lab.
* I had some trouble implementing leap year into date.py but I figured
  it out with trial and error.
* I think I could improve the way I handled leap years in [date.py](#datepy).
  It works but it's not the cleanest way to do it.
